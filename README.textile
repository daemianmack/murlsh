h1. Installation

h2. Phusion Passenger

<pre>
<code>
gem sources -a http://gemcutter.org/
gem install murlsh
</code>
</pre>

In the web directory:

<pre>
<code>
murlsh
edit config.yaml
rake db:init user:add
</code>
</pre>

h1. PubSubHubbub

Murlsh can notify "PubSubHubbub":http://code.google.com/p/pubsubhubbub/ hubs
when a new url is added by adding them to config.yaml. The pubsubhubbub_hubs
key is a list of hashes in the following format:

<pre>
<code>
pubsubhubbub_hubs:
- publish_url: http://pubsubhubbub.appspot.com/publish
  subscribe_url: http://pubsubhubbub.appspot.com/
</code>
</pre>

subscribe_url is what gets put in the feed as link rel="hub"
publish_url is where the notifications get sent
