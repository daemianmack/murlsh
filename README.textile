h1. Installation

h2. Phusion Passenger

DESTINATION_DIRECTORY is the web directory to install the murlsh site to.

<pre>
<code>
gem sources -a http://gemcutter.org/
gem install murlsh
murlsh DESTINATION_DIRECTORY
cd DESTINATION_DIRECTORY
edit config.yaml
rake init
</code>
</pre>

h2. Development

* Create a fork and check it out
* edit config.yaml
* rake init
* rackup
* open http://localhost:9292/

h2. Heroku

<pre>
<code>
gem install heroku
heroku keys:add
</code>
</pre>

Create a fork on github and clone it or clone public url:

<pre>
<code>
git clone git://github.com/mmb/murlsh.git
cd murlsh
bundle install
heroku create <choose a name>
rake heroku:config
heroku info
rake config[root_url,<your app's Heroku url>]
rake config[s3_bucket,<your S3 bucket name>]
rake config[s3_id,<your S3 id>]
rake config[s3_secret,<your S3 secret>]
</code>
</pre>

S3 is used for thumbnail storage because Heroku cannot write local files.

Other config in config.yaml is optional.

<pre>
<code>
rake user:add
git add .
git commit
git push heroku master
heroku rake db:migrate
</code>
</pre>

h1. Updating

If you are using the gem and it gets updated to a new version you should run
the murlsh command again from your web directory to update plugins, javascript
and css. It will prompt before overwriting anything in case you have made
modifications.

h1. API

h2. Recent urls

* http://your_root/atom.atom
* http://your_root/rss.rss
* http://your_root/podcast.rss (urls with audio/mpeg content type)
* http://your_root/m3u.m3u (urls with audio content types)
* http://your_root/json.json
* http://your_root/json.json?callback=x (jsonp)

h1. Thumbnails

Thumbnail images are generated from added urls using plumnailer. They are
scaled down to 'thumbnail_max_side' in config.yaml and stored locally.

Thumbnails can also be manually specified by passing their url as the
'thumbnail' parameter when adding a url. They are also scaled and stored
locally.

The plugin add_pre_40_thumbnail_shortcuts.rb can be used to specify
short names for frequently used thumbnail urls that can be passed in instead.

h1. Plugins

Classes in the plugins directory can be used to change behavior at certain
points. Each class that extends Murlsh::Plugin and sets an instance variable
called @hook will be called for that hook. Each plugin has a run() method that
accepts arguments and returns something. These methods will be called in the
order of their class names sorted lexically. Some hooks pass the output of their
run() method to the next plugin for that hook so that the data can be passed
through a chain of methods that each do something to it.

A lot of the standard behavior is implemented as plugins. See the plugins
directory for examples.

Plugin hooks

|Hook|Description|run() arguments|Returns|
|add_pre|called before a new url is saved|url, config hash|undefined|
|add_post|called after a new url is saved|url, config hash|undefined|
|avatar|called to get an avatar url from an email md5 sum|avatar url, url, config hash|avatar url|
|store_asset|store an asset somewhere where it can be loaded by url|name, data, config hash|asset url if successfully stored|
|url_display_add|called to display additional information after urls|markup builder, url, config hash|undefined|
|url_display_pre|called to modify a url on-the-fly before display, does not change database|url, rack request, config hash|undefined|

h1. PubSubHubbub

Murlsh can notify "PubSubHubbub":http://code.google.com/p/pubsubhubbub/ hubs
when a new url is added by adding them to config.yaml. The pubsubhubbub_hubs
key is a list of hashes in the following format:

<pre>
<code>
pubsubhubbub_hubs:
- publish_url: http://pubsubhubbub.appspot.com/publish
  subscribe_url: http://pubsubhubbub.appspot.com/
</code>
</pre>

publish_url is where the notifications get sent
subscribe_url is what gets put in the feed as link rel="hub"

This will make updates to your feed show up in Google Reader instantly.
